# encoder-decoder
This is a simple chat encoder/decoder that uses custom keys that you can make to encode/decode

It's honestly pretty simple, no external packages too.

To use it, ask someone for a key or create your own, make sure it is in the key folder, then open the encrypt-decrypt file and follow the stuff there.
